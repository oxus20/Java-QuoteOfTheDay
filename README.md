#Java Quote of the Day
Quote of the Day program displays a different quote each day of the year as the quote of the day. The program picks a random quote from an array of quotes based on day of the year; and keeps showing that selected quote for the whole day and change to a new one the next day.


**NOTE:** Remember and keep in mind the already picked and selected quotes should not pick again until the next year.
